# Y-Combinator-Impl
![y.combinator](img/y-combinator.png)

This is my implementations of the Y-Combinator in different programming languages. The Y-Combinator is a way to make recursive functions in programming languages which does not support it. It was discovered by [Haskell B. Curry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haskell_Curry) and defined using [Lambda Calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus).


## Inspiration
I learned about the Y-combinator when watching the [Computerphile](https://www.youtube.com/user/Computerphile) video about the [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed-point_combinator) after watching their video about [Lambda Calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus).. I did not quite understand it at first. Therefore I decided to try and implement it to get a better understand it

## Z-Combinator

My implementations except for in `Haskell` is the Z-Combinator, which is the Y-Combinator for eager evaluating languages. This prevents infinte loops by wrapping the inner function in another lambda.
